# Android DarkNet Server (Boilerplate)

## Overview
The Android DarkNet Server project is an Android application designed to integrate Tor and a simple web server, enabling the device to host a hidden service accessible through the Tor network. This project is a boilerplate intended for developers who want to quickly set up a hidden service on Android. It is not for production use!Only for developers who needs an basic boilerplatte for ther ideas. It will be not explainet here to avoid criminals for creating iligal sites.
